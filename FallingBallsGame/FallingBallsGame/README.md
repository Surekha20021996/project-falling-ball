Section 1: Project Description
The Falling Balls project is a single-player game developed in Java, designed to entertain and challenge the player's hand-eye coordination and reaction speed. In this game, the player must use the mouse to slice falling balls of various colors, earning points for each successful slice. The game introduces an additional challenge with red balls acting as bombs; slicing these bombs will end the game immediately, so players must be cautious with each move.

The game is designed to increase in difficulty over time, with balls falling at progressively faster speeds, intensifying the gameplay and requiring the player to stay attentive. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by slicing balls and avoiding bombs within a set time limit. By rewarding quick reactions and penalizing mistakes, the game offers an engaging, fast-paced experience.

Section 2: Overview
The Falling Balls game primarily aims to provide users with a fun way to practice hand-eye coordination and quick reflexes. By incorporating elements of challenge and reward, it enhances player engagement. The core concept is straightforward: the player controls a "cutting" action with the mouse, which they must use to slice as many balls as possible while avoiding red bombs.

The game operates within a well-defined scope:

Single-Player Mode: The game is designed for a single player, focusing on individual skill development and self-competition.
Progressive Difficulty: As the player progresses, the speed and frequency of falling balls increase, raising the game's difficulty level and maintaining player engagement.
Score Tracking: The game records the player's score, allowing for continuous feedback and motivation to achieve higher scores in subsequent attempts.
Timer: The gameplay is time-limited, with players encouraged to maximize their score within the set duration.
To keep the gameplay experience focused and streamlined, several features are intentionally excluded, including:

Multiplayer Mode: Only single-player mode is available to keep the gameplay experience straightforward.
Advanced Power-ups: The game avoids complex mechanics such as power-ups to maintain simplicity.
Online Leaderboards: Scores are tracked locally without any online ranking system.
Mobile Compatibility: The game is exclusively designed for desktop environments, using Java Swing for graphical elements.
Section 3: System Architecture
The Falling Balls game's architecture combines user interface elements with core gameplay logic, all built in Java using the Swing framework for the graphical user interface (GUI).

User Interface Layer:

This layer handles user input and displays game elements like falling balls, bombs, score, and timer. It interacts with the player through mouse movements, translating these actions into "cuts" on the screen.
The graphical interface provides visual feedback for each successful slice, animating the ball's disappearance or splitting effect and updating the score display in real-time.
Gameplay Logic Layer:

This layer is responsible for implementing the game’s core functionality:
Ball Generation: Randomly generates and displays colored balls falling from the top of the screen. Some balls are designated as bombs, adding an extra layer of challenge.
Collision Detection: Detects when the mouse intersects with a ball, determining if the player successfully slices a ball or accidentally hits a bomb.
Score Management: Calculates and updates the player's score based on successful slices, with bonuses for consecutive cuts achieved within a short time frame.
Timer Mechanism: Manages the countdown timer for the game, regulating the length of each game session and controlling the speed increase for falling balls.
Data Management Layer:

Stores essential game data, such as the player's score, game state (active or game over), and configuration settings (e.g., game duration, ball frequency, and difficulty adjustments).
Section 4: Data Dictionary
The data dictionary defines and explains the key data elements used in the Falling Balls game.

Score: An integer variable that tracks the number of points a player earns throughout the game.

Data Type: Integer
Purpose: Records the player’s cumulative score, displayed on the screen to provide immediate feedback.
Ball: Represents each falling object on the screen, which can be sliced by the player.

Data Type: Object
Attributes: position (x and y coordinates), color (indicates regular or bomb status), cutStatus (whether the ball has been sliced).
Purpose: Acts as the main interactive object in the game, offering the player a target to slice or avoid.
Bomb: A specific type of Ball object that behaves like a bomb; slicing it ends the game.

Data Type: Object (inherits properties from Ball)
Attributes: Inherits from Ball but includes an additional flag to end the game if cut.
Purpose: Introduces a risk element, requiring players to selectively slice only safe balls.
Timer: A countdown mechanism that controls the duration of each game session.

Data Type: Integer
Purpose: Limits game length and adds urgency to the gameplay, encouraging players to act quickly to maximize their score.
Section 5: Data Design
The data design organizes the elements into structures and sequences that support the game's logic.

Data Structures:

List or Array of Balls: Used to store multiple Ball objects. Each ball's properties (position, color, cut status) are individually managed, allowing for real-time updating as the balls move or are sliced.
Score Counter: A single integer variable tracking the player's score, updated continuously as the player slices balls.
Game Timer: A countdown mechanism implemented with Java's Timer class, regulating both the game session duration and the frequency with which new balls are generated.
Game Flow and Logic:

The game begins with a timer set for a predetermined duration, during which balls begin falling from the top of the screen. Players use the mouse to slice balls, earning points for each successful cut.
The system checks each frame to detect mouse intersections with balls. If a collision with a regular ball is detected, the score increases; if a collision with a bomb is detected, the game ends immediately.
Section 6: User Interface Design
The user interface is built using Java Swing, featuring an intuitive layout and visual elements that enhance gameplay engagement.

Game Screen:

Ball Display: Displays balls falling from the top to the bottom of the screen. The balls vary in color and include both regular balls (which can be sliced) and bombs (which should be avoided).
Score Display: Positioned prominently to keep players informed of their current score throughout the game.
Timer Display: Shows the remaining time for the session, motivating players to maximize their score before time runs out.
Visual Effects: When a player slices a ball, the game provides immediate visual feedback, such as animating the ball’s disappearance or a slicing effect, making gameplay more engaging.
Controls:

The player interacts using the mouse. The mouse cursor acts as the slicing tool, and any intersection between the cursor and a ball triggers a cut. Players can pause and resume the game using designated keyboard keys or mouse clicks.
Additional Features:

Combo System: To reward skilled players, a combo system grants extra points for slicing multiple balls in quick succession without hitting a bomb. This system encourages players to develop a rhythm and avoid mistakes.
Pause/Resume Feature: This feature allows players to pause the game as needed and resume it later without losing progress. This is particularly helpful for longer sessions.
